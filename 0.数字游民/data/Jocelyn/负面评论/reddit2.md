Does Anyone Else Think The Term "Digital Nomad" Sucks [Serious]

I cringe whenever i hear anyone refer to themselves as a digital nomad.

I cringe when i hear myself refer to myself as a digital nomad.

I cringe when i hear people refer to us as digital nomads.

It just sounds very pompous and douchey to me, right up there with "wantrepreneurs".

I have this conversation with other nomads i meet in coworking spaces around the world - and to be honest i have found that there are not a whole bunch of positive reactions to the term.

I very much doubt the term DN could change even if we wanted it to - its pretty entrenched and there are obviously vested interests who favour keeping the name the same.

But what are your thoughts? Do have any humorous / serious suggestions for an alternative name?

Yeah, digital nomad is the worst term I've ever heard. I hate it. It sounds like it was made up by some marketing company.

The sun rises over Mount Fuji

Announcer: With advancements in remote-work technology, a new breed of human has emerged.

Cue a tall dude and dudette looking majestically into the distance with devil-may-care smiles. They're both wearing merino wool tshirts, jeans, socks, underwear, etc...heck - I think their shoes are made of merino too! Oh yes, and of course they have backpacks.

Announcer: The digital nomad! Once, an oft-dreamed about advancement by worker bees in industries ever, finally made possible as a direct result of Tim Ferris and his buddies.

The dude and dudette are at a cafe, working away with way more electronic accessories than could possibly fit in those bags

Waitress: Are you guys going to order anything, or...
Dudette: looking at the dude Hah, it reminds me of that time we were in that frutatarian commune in New Zealand
Dude: Oh man, that was a riot! It was so unique! looks at the waitress you can check out the pictures on our blog if you want. We're bloggers.
Waitress: I uh...I really just need to take your order, sir
Dudette: Did he mention that we're bloggers?

Announcer: After finally having thrown down the shackles of a fixed-address, the first truly FREE members of the human race are coming to a coffee shop...near you. By the way, they blog, did they mention that?

When people ask me what I do, I tell them what I do. I don't tell them I'm a digital nomad.

By the way, did I mention I blog? You guys should check out my blog.

To me "working remotely" could mean you work a regular 9-to-5 but your office is just the next state over. It doesn't quite capture the traveler/entrepreneur essence that digital nomad does. Also, hated as it may be, "digital nomad" is useful for finding others like you both online and in-person.

Location-independent-nomadtrepreneur. LoL. Yea, people do give that "you douchebag" look when ya use that phrase. I tried telling a couple friends once that I was location independent (about a week after travelling the country for an entire year working) and they just laughed. Yea. I feel ya. Then again a lot of ppl where im from will laugh at any unconventional phrase. Ha. And I laugh at some of them secretly for being so judgemental. Even if I try to help them work less hours and make MORE money, many still scoff at the very idea of 'digital nomadding' as well as laughing at the phrase. Even just staying in their hometown forever and making cash on an interweb, it seems to many people as some kinda fairy tale lol. Their loss.

I coined the term "technomad" in 1984, after calling myself a "high-tech nomad" for a while and wanting a slightly slimmer moniker. In 1989, I started the Technomads listserve while at Sun working on BEHEMOTH (the final version of the bike) and it ran for about 15 years... with lots of interesting discussions about who we are, what does this mean, and so on. The name stuck for many, and I still like it, though it is imperfectly defined.

(I also played with "Yuppie Hobo" briefly but that one fortunately didn't stick!)

I'm still doing technomadic projects (see http://microship.com), but made the classic too much complexity error and the ratio of lab time to adventure went non-linear. I've been living aboard a 44-foot steel sailboat for a few years, building console systems but not actually getting off the dock due to back problems. I'm now selling Nomadness and getting something sleeker (and small enough to fit in my lab during long hackage phases).

I've been modularizing my toolset lately, with the general intent of reducing clutter and getting substrate-independent. This is as important as location-independence; it's too easy to get defined/limited by a specialized mobile platform.

By the way, I just returned from a consulting sojourn to Silicon Valley and had a chance to go visit my bike in the Computer History Museum. Really took me back. sniff

Yes. It sounds so obnoxious I'm surprised it ever caught on.

I don't think "remote worker" quite captures the same thing, as there are plenty of folks who work from home but their company's office is in another city/state or whatever, but they're not actually traveling and don't intend to.

If pressed I usually explain that I'm able to travel and work at the same time, because I'm able to perform my work anywhere in the world as long as I have my laptop and wifi. Not quite a catchy term though.

If I think about it, I probably most often say "I work online, so I can live anywhere". It's wordier, but at least it doesn't sound as cringeworthy as "digital nomad".

I couldn't agree more, I've always hated the term even though I'm pretty much the definition of a Digital Nomad. It does sound super douchey and pretentious. It doesn't help that the people I've met who actually identify as a DN really are total douches.

Because of this, I just tell people I work remotely for clients in the US and Europe. This seems to satisfy most people and then we can move on to discussing things that actually matter.

I don't really get the hate. Its as fine a term as anything else I've ever heard.

    "Working remotely" doesn't do it because it doesn't imply any level of travel.
    
    "Perpetual traveler" doesn't do it either because it doesn't imply working or the nature of the work.
    
    "Hobo" or whatever variation there doesn't work because it has some negative connotations.
    
    "Location independent" is fine with me, its just a mouthfull to tell anyone.
    
    "Technomad" is fine with me; its actually the term I used before DN caught on.

Also, for what its worth, I find it interesting how different the shards of this community are. I feel like this is an opinion I've only heard vocalized on this subreddit.

I tend to agree. Apparently I was a "digital nomad" since 2005 without even knowing what the term meant (or that it existed) until last year. I think it's just human nature to want to identify with a tribe of some sort, and people gravitate to labels. For years I just said "I work online" and still do say that. I don't actually tell people I'm a "digital nomad". I can definitely tell when people are using it as a brag (most of the time). One good thing about the term is that it allows us to find related content on Google compared to not having any sort of common description or uniform term

then don't use it. Whenever people ask me what I do I don't tell them, because what does it matter what I do? It isn't who I am. I am not a digital nomad, I'm not a remote worker, I'm not an entrepreneur, I'm not any of those things, I'm just me and I like what I like and that's who I am, not what I do.

So someone asks "what do you for a living?" you say "I'm just me, and I like who I am"? I get not bringing up digital nomadry (I agree with OP), but that's like going from Silicon Valley to Portlandia. I propose "I make websites".

No, I say I travel and game. My job is not who I am. Where I come from, people never asked "what do you do". They asked where you were from and that's it. I disagree with current work culture and so I try to do what very little I can to change it.

I think there's something there also: even if you do identify by your job, "digital nomad" isn't actually that. I'm a mechanical designer regardless of being in-house or freelance or travel while I'm freelance etc.

The nomad part describes a lifestyle, true, but it's sort of the minimum useful information that can answer that question and like you, I'd at least like to be useful in answering the real question which is trying to get a feel for who I am and what I enjoy, or at least what I do for money. "Digital nomad" isn't really any of those things

Every generation of hobos wants to find a better name than "hobos". But basically, that is what you are.

A "hobo" and a tramp both travel constantly. The tramp is looking for handouts, the hobo is willing to work.

You are hobos. You don't need to qualify it with a computer related name. You do the modern equivalent of picking crops, sweeping up and painting the fence.

I'm not sure it's really fair to put someone who has created their own business online - regardless of how many figures they are making - in the same category as a guy wandering around painting fences. One of these people took the initiative to create a business. The other is just accepting whatever work they can find.

I'm in this camp; the term doesn't bother me, and I don't get that db ring either. But then again, I don't socialize or know anyone who'd fit this irl, so I'm sure this figures in.

Also, "digital nomad" sounds like a lifestyle to me, not an occupation or source of income. In describing the lifestyle I'd love to hear good alternatives that work as well. I wander, I'm averse to gathering a lot of stuff or a residence, and I am wired, to be sure. By virtual of my work, as well as several of my interests.

For many self styled 'Digital Nomads', they are nothing more than 1 year travellers with a laptop. IMO you need to be on the road for 3+ years to be considered to be living a nomadic lifestyle?

I hate it. But I was one before the term existed and never really could identify my lifestyle as anything specific. Now it helps me find like-minded people online and google searches easier.

In comparison to any of the other terms, it's the one I'm most comfortable with, however I don't use it in real life. Although on that note, I don't discuss what I do in real life either. Nobody's business.
