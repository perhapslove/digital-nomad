The two phrases "like a boss" and "crushing it" make me want to hurt people. They seem to occur in every bland, tedious piece about living in the third world as a digital nomad making no money at all.

Not a single person I know who I've heard saying they are "crushing it" ever crushed anything other than their bank account. There must be successful entrepreneurs who say that, but I've never met any of them. I have met people who say they are crushing their app or web site or ebook or whatever, but then they just disappear when their money runs out.

But to be honest I have a friend that is an incredibly successful e-gaming superaffiliate (He runs Gambling.com) and I love Charles to death but he says "crushing it" all the time.

He says "crushing it" so much that I started saying "crushing it" when we were hanging out a lot, and I hate the phrase "crushing it"

What really irritates me are landing pages. Everything seems to evolve around building a likeable image of a person who is always happy, super successful, makes a lot of money and can’t wait to tell you how to do it, too. I’ve been working remotely since 2009 and you don’t see me selling my knowledge; I’ve helped many people for free over the years and don’t give a crap if they made money from my information.

All this nonsense trying to make easy money is grinding my gears. People have no respect, they treat others like balls and do not care that they practically cheat customers for some money so they can survive one more week wherever they are.

Hell, how many of those wannabe DMs think about ethical design or not selling customer data? I’ve been over these topics for months before I launched my blog and it drove me nuts trying to find a reasonable way around Google Analytics and using a Wordpress sharing plug-in that doesn’t call home; I found a GA alternative eventually but it’s not free. Still, I prefer not selling my visitors data to some data collection agency and pay out of my pocket — but who thinks like that? Nobody who craps out some website from a free template in five minutes with a few buzz words, tries to collect emails and sell them to the highest bidder.

This. I've helped more people than I can count over the years, many of them solidly grateful until this very day but I didn't charge $997 to do it (or anything ending a $7 price tag). I just helped. I don't mind people flogging knowledge for a few bucks (or its professional worth) but when you have $2,000 "how to dropship courses" which are worth at a ceiling rate $20 - there's something really wrong in the world.

There is that. I give away advice and information too, take it or leave it.

What amazes me is when people ask for basic info they can Google -- "How many days can I get in Thailand on a visa waiver?" -- which makes me wonder how they plan to live away from their parents. Or when I answer a question -- sometimes with a long answer -- and then I am asked to actually do the work for them, like help them find a job or write a resume or join my LinkedIn network.

We'll always have predators and people trying to make a quick buck. It's a shame they have infected the DN "community" to the point that it's both a problem and cause for ridicule. I don't think most DNs or wannabe DNs are just takers or scam artists, but we need to call out those who are scamming and taking advantage of honest people who may not know how to get started.

That DN means being 23 years old, broke and live in Thailand. I'm not young, I'm not poor and once the kids finish high school (3 years!) I'm planning to travel Europe and the western US and Canada and ski in the winter and hike/bike in the summer. While running my successful software business remotely. I guess if I do that I'm not a "real" digital nomad? :-)

Always partying, never working.

The hardest part is because I can work my own hours there is an expectation I'm available at all hours. - not the same.

A conversation can overcome this, but I hate having to push back and justify why I want to work those hours and not reschedule. As it's usually a well intentioned mistake by people who want to spend time with me.

I object when people say or write that they want to be a DN or become a DN, as if it's a new identity or body they will assume. "Working remotely while traveling" is more descriptive and emphasizes the "working" part. I also don't think every freelance gig from UpWork or side project or even attempt to install Ruby/Rails qualifies as a "startup."

References to the "digital nomad community" are pretty bad too. Community is pretty much the opposite of nomadism.

Uh, this subreddit is a community of people who are interested in or actively participating in the way of life we could call "being a digital nomad". If you thought community was the opposite of digital nomadism, then I imagine you wouldn't be communicating with us on Reddit right now.

    "Working remotely while traveling" is more descriptive and emphasizes the "working" part.

When someone who's unfamiliar with the way of life we talk about on this subreddit hears "digital nomad", they ask for more information. If they hear "working remotely while traveling", they just think the person is a normal individual who has a permanent residence in a particular country and is currently on a temporarily travel schedule while conveniently being able to continue keeping up with work emails and other tasks.

The term "digital nomad" was invented in order to refer to an entirely new way of life that's still unfamiliar to most people. By avoiding that term and instead saying "working remotely while traveling", it seems like you're just trying to phrase the lifestyle in a way that comes off as normal to normal people, at the expense of clarity.

The problem is what the term has become. There is a stigma attached by the people using it as a marketing term and calling them digital nomads without actually doing any work or building a business around anything other than the fact that they are a digital nomad. Classic MLM crap. "I'm rich and successful I can show you how if you buy my shit" next thing you know your the guy selling the shit realising that you are selling nothing but an image.

Call me old-fashioned. I think of community as people I know, or may know someday, in real life. I don't think of it as people who happen to have some vague characteristics or lifestyle choices in common. Posting and arguing in online forums is not a community to me, I probably have very little in common with the people in this sub, except that I work remotely while traveling and others here either do that, or want to, or used to. This is entertainment and sometimes education for me, not community. But I'm aware that the word community has that usage in English (LGBT community, cancer survivor community, expat community, MacBook Pro community, yoga community). To me that kind of phony community label doesn't describe anything usefully, and turns into a cliche, like digital nomad. There's a difference between a far-flung group of people joined by a common bond or experience (think Marines), who do make up a community, and people who managed to buy a laptop, backpack, and a plane ticket, who don't.

I understand that digital nomad is just a shorthand, but it has been extended to include so many lifestyles, from wannabe to backpacker on a budget to part-time remote employee to freelancer to expat, that it doesn't have any descriptive value. I get it, I even refer to myself as a DN sometimes, although I'm also an expatriate and have more in common with that group, except I also do technical freelancing online.

It's not an "entirely new way of life." Everything that 20-somethings discover is not new, just new to them. People have been doing this for a long time, not using the DN label. I don't see how telling "normal people" (who are they?) that I'm a digital nomad is more clear than telling them that I work remotely while traveling. Even normal people get that. Generally when people ask what I do I tell them I'm retired.

I don't care about phrasing the lifestyle or making anyone understand or approve (I'm f'ing 56 years old). I just don't have much in common with the first-time-abroad backpackers with stars and dreams in their eyes, lugging around two huge packs wearing chang pants in Chiang Mai. Good luck to them, I'm sure some of them are great people, but we don't have enough in common for me to call it a community, or for me to want "normal people" to think we are making the same choices.

There are plenty of people in the digital-nomad community who meet up in person. There are co-working spaces, cities which are popular with digital nomads, etc.

It means someone who's location independent not because they're financially independent but because they work remotely, especially if they use that life situation as an opportunity to hop around between many different countries and spend weeks or months at a time at each destination. You may dislike the way some digital nomads generally live their day-to-day life, but that doesn't take away from the obvious meaning of the term. Your complaint is identical to saying we shouldn't use the term "college student" anymore because some people who are attending college do things that annoy you, like skip some of their classes or talk loudly in the library.

I don't know why you're trying to explain it to me. I've been doing this for a while and I've participated in several online DN forums. I've written articles about how i work as a DN. So I know what it means. I just don't like the term. Use it if you want to.

I also know about meetups, co-working working, etc. I do that too. Maybe a community comes out of getting to know people you meet at places like that. But just calling yourself a DN doesn't mean you've joined a global community of anything.

Digital nomad doesn't mean anything to "normal people," as you put it. Even self-described DNs can't agree on what it means.

It's a cliche. Perhaps a useful one. I don't care what people call themselves.

@Eric_Wulff, I do think you're missing the point.

It doesn't matter if some people meet in person. The same could be said of many groups that most people would not consider a community.

I think the main point is that a community is defined as:

    a group of people living in the same place or having a particular characteristic in common.
    
    a feeling of fellowship with others, as a result of sharing common attitudes, interests, and goals.

With #1, that's usually people grouped together by geography. The Chiang Mai community. The German community. Obviously there's no way all of those people have agreed to be part of that community but it's a way of making a generalization about a large group of people who have been involuntarily grouped together.

And #2 is problematic as well. I feel no fellowship with other expats or DNs simply based on the fact that we like to travel. There are certainly groups of people who I do feel a fellowship with as a result of common attitudes, interests, and goals with who also are location independent but that does not mean that I share a fellowship with everyone who happens to do Fiverr gigs from a shared workspace in Chiang Mai. Much in the same way that I don't feel a fellowship with someone who writes an article about property taxes simply because I own real estate and pay property taxes.

Unfortunately, the term community has really been perverted in the age of social media. It has come to mean any group of people who interact with each other. But that is not really a community. That's simply the definition social media companies have put on content not produced by paid staff/freelancers.

To illustrate the difference, let's say that there's a coworking space in Bangkok. Let's also say that there are roughly 100 unique users per month. Those 100 people are not a community. They're 100 individuals who all happen to be paying customers of the coworking space. If the coworking space sponsors a networking event, that still doesn't make these 100 individuals a community.

Now, if 10 of those individuals happen to all be working on writing iOS apps and they organize and get together with the purpose of helping each other out, that's when you start getting closer to being a community. They've actually taken some action demonstrating common attitudes, interests, and goals. Whether that develops into a fellowship is a completely different question but it's much closer to being called a community than thousands of people on a message board who self-proclaim themselves digital nomads.

This. It doesn't matter how many "Facebook friends" you have, it matters how many of them are happy to join you for a drink after work.

Social media seems to have led to a huge breakdown in people's ability to recognize what's important in their lives. There are lots of people who insist "community" exists based on some minor similarity between two (or more) people.
level 7

One of the things I've noticed is that people who tend to cling to "community" tend to be net takers in the system. In other words, someone can't figure out how to live a financially independent lifestyle while traveling so they join a group online and ask others to show them how. They rely on the "community" to tell them where the co-working spaces are, what the internet speeds are, how much the taxi ride from the airport is, etc.

What you don't see as often, is them putting back in. First off, most never become successful because they can't do anything for themselves and eventually they run out of couches to surf on and people to mooch energy from. Those who somehow defy the odds and make a little money tend to guard their success very selfishly.

EDITORIAL NOTE: I'm not saying that all DN's are like this. I'm saying the ones who tend to grasp onto the "community" aspect of it do.

I see this in almost every type of "community." It's not exclusive to digital nomads. For many people "community" means, "Wow, a lot of people can help me!"

Not just misunderstanding what DN means. That's a fairly common question on DN forums. It shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the job market and the relationship between a college degree and skills. I think you're right that the DN and FHWW hype lead some people to see it as an alternative to developing marketable skills and actually working. The get rich quick scammers who now prey on wide-eyed DNs have some easy targets.

This is why you see certain aspects of it get oversaturated so quickly. How many travel writers can the world support? How many vlogs?

But this is no different than the real world. Over the years I have tried to convince so many people that you are only as valuable as the value you create for someone else. Don't go into a job interview and tell them what skills you have, tell them how you can make them money or solve their problems.

But people don't get that. They think about everything all from the perspective of, what am I worth? How can I live off that?

Listen, I make a good six-figure salary with lots of bonuses and perks. But if I decided to become a gardener tomorrow, nobody is willing to pay me extra for that. My knowledge and skills in other areas don't create value in the realm of mowing lawns. People are only going to pay me in relation to the value I create.

And that's the part I think a lot of aspiring DN's miss. They think being a DN is in and of itself worth something. It's not. Ultimately, someone has to give you money and they want value in exchange for that money.

For instance, when I read FHWW, what I took away from it was that if you want that lifestyle, spend 5 years building up a network of clients and then go become a world traveling designer or software engineer. I did not take away from it that you should go immediately from graduation to buying a plane ticket to Chiang Mai and doing jobs off of oDesk for third-world rates.

The whole point of FHWW was basically COL arbitrage. Earn money in Location A with a high cost of living while traveling and living in Location B with a low cost of living. Use the COL differential to allow you to live a life of freedom.

But most DNs have it the other way around. They bail from a HCOL county with little or no savings, no regular source of income, no network of business, and then compete with people in India for jobs on outsourcing sites. All you're doing then is making money based on a LCOL and living somewhere with a LCOL. No arbitrage. Congrats! You're now hustling just as hard as you would back home but for third-world wages!

The term "digital nomad" itself. I mean, when I talk with someone and they claim "I'm a digital nomad", I personally don't like it. It'll be completely different if they say things like "I build websites" or "I do social media" or something similar to that context. But "digital nomad", it's Like a title just to show off

Nevermind, I'll just pack my bags for Chiang Mai and write an e-book about vegan restaurants in Nimman but only the ones in the odd numbered sois because I am too scared to cross the main road to the even numbered ones.

You sound very critical of Chiang Mai or at least the people living there. May I ask why? I know it is the go to hub for DNs but is there a reason other than the fact it gets spouted this way? I lived there for 3 months last year and I'm back for another 3 month stretch, I honestly never interact with other nomads so I never really know the level everyone else is on or what they really talk about.

It's the noisemaker for an imaginary "digital nomad lifestyle". A lifestyle which consists of pretending to be successful and never interacting with Thailand at all. They all live in Nimman but are never seen at any of the nice restaurants and bars in Nimman (because they can't afford them) and blog endlessly about veganism, gyms and nothing of any value whatsoever.

They are the primary reason that most people would prefer not to be known as a "digital nomad". I liked Chiang Mai too, I've spent a lot of time there but the "DNs" that live there and participate in the "digital nomad lifestyle circle jerk" are often among the lowest forms of life on the planet.

Haha got cha. Glad I never had the displeasure of meeting with these people. The friends me and my girlfriend made in Chiang Mai was the owner of the cafe we frequented the most, a retired marathon runner who lived in our apartment building, a retired millionaire therapist (who had a very interesting life story) and that was basically it. I never cared for meeting other people working online or trying to because well part of the whole idea was to get away from people doing the same shit I was.

I arrived back in Chiang Mai about a week ago and there seems to be a whole lot more digital nomads wondering around but still have no intentions interacting with them i'd rather focus on interests outside of smashing keys on a laptop all day.

Being broke, living in a hostel and working in a coffee shop. Personally, in my opinion, if you are working as a Software Dev and all you can afford is living in a hostel you are doing something seriously wrong. You may be saving lots of money but the distraction rate is so high...

Oh, and please stop carrying a huge back-pack in most SE Asian cities. Once you learn the language or make friends with locals you will find out how many are making jokes at you. You don't need a back-pack in Bangkok. I've even seen backpackers in Singapore...

Did something traumatic happen to you when you were wearing a backpack?

LOL no. :) I just find it a terrible cliché. There's a time and a place for hiking with a huge back-pack. Marina Bay Sands isn't one of them. :)

I always thought the huge backpack people were going from somewhere to their hotel or vice versa. Do they actually just hike around the city with them?

I've seen them being used in areas which aren't direct routes to anywhere. It's very strange seeing them being used.

Why does a backpack need to be huge? I only travel hand-luggage-only with my backpack. I have a hard time taking people serious that bring suitcases on boats/islands.

That's stupid. I carry a backpack everywhere because it's easy to get on as carry-on baggage and to move around with. I couldn't give a fuck if some random Thai is making fun of me. If they find the sight of someone carrying a backpack offensive then maybe they should focus on their own lives and stop being so narrow minded.

They don't... I have no idea where he gets this thing about "backpacks" which are perfectly practical. I can't imagine the average Thai thinks twice about people's choice of luggage to be honest, I think it's from his own hangups.

Even in Singapore! Can you believe it! A person with a backpack in Singapore, I mean don't they know it's the death penalty for that?

I get your point, but I'm a fulltime software dev looking forward to spending a few months in hostels this year, saving a shitload of money, meeting lots of people, etc. And even when I'm working from my company's office, I'll spend half the day in a nearby coffee shop just because the white noise actually helps me focus.

Wait, I just noticed you said all you can afford - okay, in that case I totally agree with you haha.

Nothing wrong with Hostels. Personally I love them because it's such a great way to meet others in a new place.

What about a Louis Vuitton backpack? I've seen those in Singapore and Hong Kong.

I kind of meant the huge great backpacks. Lots of the small Louis Vuitton ones in SG. :)

I've seen some frigging massive backpacks, sometimes front and back. I think the biggest I've seen were on Koh Tao, big enough to put a child inside. I assumed they were full of scuba gear, but then I saw a couple rooting through their packs and it was all clothes and random shit they could buy anywhere, assuming they needed it.

In Bangkok I feel simultaneously bad for and angry with the backpackers lugging around their gigantic 300 liter packs with two pairs of shoes, a blanket and pillow, and a lawn chair attached. Especially on the BTS or MRT during rush hour. What part of tropical climate didn't they get?

This thread has unearthed why this sub is so negative all the time. Thanks

Really? Or is it just a reality check for people who have their head so far in the clouds that they will believe any marketing hype and not realize it.

Read through a majority of the other comments. We aren't saying these things because we are jealous or want to create negativity. The fact is that there are people who have turned Digital Nomad into a marketing term to lure in people who would love to work remotely. They sell crappy courses, ebooks and programs creating no real value. Basically you showing a lifestyle that is only attainable by doing what they are doing which is selling crappy courses, ebooks and programs enticing others to the DN lifestyle. It's basically a pyramid scheme/MLM.

There are plenty of legitimate digital nomads out there who work remotely and live a comfortable lifestyle actually creating value and doing great things and I created this thread to basically bring awareness to these cliches people are sick of seeing, creating a stigma towards working remotely overseas.

I agree that the term is becoming toxic because of marketing cycle that some people are creating. Thank you for encouraging awareness.

To explain my original comment:

I often see posts of value or good questions that havent been asked before and it gets downvoted for no apparent reason (usually no comments either).

So when this post which has "hate" in the title and encourages rants gets a lot of up votes and a spirited discussion, it confirmed my view that this is a sub with a generally negative tone.

For example, another user is being hostile towards me for my original comment in this thread. I dont really understand why. Its just my opinion based on what I have seen in this sub. But their behavior towards me continues to confirm my view.

I'm not saying that all the comments here are just pure hate or nonsense. In fact most of the discussion is funny because it's true, and may be a useful or balancing reality check for those new to the term. There's also amazing content in this sub. The quality of this sub is good. I just find that the general tone is usually skewed negative.

Edit: and by the way, even a mod here shares my view.

You might try thinking more and speaking less. Nobody is being hostile to you, except in your imagination, your viewpoints - however - ARE being challenged. Saying "stop being so negative" does not make you or indeed any number of mods, right on the issues of the day. It just makes you tedious.

You need to learn the difference between "hate" as in "I hate pickles on my burgers" (insignificant and common usage) and "hate" as in "I hate Jews and Auschwitz was a good thing" (which is real hate). The fact that you can't differentiate between these things, suggests a lack of exposure to a broad spectrum of humanity rather than a fault in the OP.

Imagine a sub that takes a critical approach to life rather than congratulating people for stupidity and laziness. That would be awful. I can see how this disturbs you.

Really? Not seen much of a difference in the eyes of people who label things "negative." This sub is full of helpful advice in amongst the occasional "fuck this bullshit" topic. The fact that you can't see it - says more about you than this sub.

I'm with you on this. I love my life, we are so fortunate to do what we do. It makes me sad that this sub is more of a complaint board or a hostile mob toward people who are interested in a new lifestyle and have questions. I never understood why so many people here seem so unhappy.

It's a split group between people actually working, making money and traveling. Then there are those that can't make a dime and they rip down people who actually do. These two groups attack each other on every topic because one wants things to be taken seriously and offer real advice and the other wants to keep their dreams alive and want to avoid anything that threatens their ego.
